_a collaborative digital archaeology primer_

Archaeology has been 'digital' or 'computational' for many decades now. Much of this work revolves around statistical analysis or closed databases, proprietary GIS and powerful analytical devices (from XRD to GPR). It seems to me though that there is a gap in the training of archaeologists that emerges from the explosion of open source and open access materials. Coupled with this are the battles surrounding publishing, the precariousness of labour in a digital world, and the fleeting eye-of-Sauron that is social media.

There are initiatives underway that address these issues; work by Ethan Watrall and Lynn Goldstein leading the NEH-funded [Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice](http://digitalarchaeology.msu.edu/) for instance is introducing such issues, tools, techniques, and informed criticism, to approximately 35 individuals from across North America. My own [Crafting Digital History](http://site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca) open-access course at Carleton University was populated by a significant number of professional archaeologists and graduate students looking for guidance, tutorials, and support. Anecdotally then I believe there is a demand for something like this *digital archaeology primer.* I'm not calling this a 'text-book' because a text-book implies the existence of a class. Before we can get to a class, I think we need to provide enough materials to prime the pump: to enable the interested individual to find what they need, in great enough detail, for a self-directed learning experience. (Please forgive me if I break into edubabble). 

Primers focus on the basics. They establish common grammars and frameworks upon which others might design lessons, modules, or indeed, courses. My own [workbook for crafting digital history](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca) is perhaps a useful model here.

## an invitation

I have no intention of writing a digital archaeology primer on my own. Rather, I would like to invite interested folks to **fork** this repository (i.e., *make a copy of it by clicking on the 'fork' button*), find a topic as indicated by the sub-folders that interests them, and then write what needs to be written. If something has already been written, fork and make suggestions / additions / deletions as you see fit. Then issue a 'pull' request (i.e, *alert me to the existence of changes you'd like me to pull into the main repository*).  In terms of style: write in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), used in-line citations, put full references at the end, link generously, and put all images in the /images/ folder using this naming convention: `yourname-targetfilename.png`. PNGs are preferred, I think. When you write a file to one of the folders, don't call it `readme.md` nor edit the readme; instead, use this convention: `yoursurname-topic.md`. That way, I hope to avoid conflicts. 

Slowly, we'd build up a repository of materials. Periodically, I'll grab all the materials and tidy everything up to make pretty epub, html, and pdf versions that may be put on syllabi, printed out, used in class, and so on.

### but writing in github is a right pain in the arse

Yes. Yes it often is. You might prefer to try the following. 

1. Sign up for a github account
2. Take a copy of this repo by clicking the 'fork' button.
3. Go to [prose.io](http://prose.io). It will ask you to 'authenticate on github'. Say yes. It will then show you a list of repositories you have access to - including this one, since you've already forked it. Then you can just click on the folder you want to work in, and use Prose's WYSIWYG editor to write and save to your repository. When you want to fold your changes into this main repository, just send me an email or tweet and I'll talk you through it.
4. There are other options - [dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) (use the 'import from' and then 'save to' options), [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/), [classier](http://classeur.io/) and no doubt many more. Of these options, Prose is probably is the gentlest.

## annotations

You might not feel inclined to write something for scratch, but you still might like to contribute. I think feedback and commenting can be done effectively using the [hypothes.is plugin for chrome](https://hypothes.is/). Install that plugin. Then, with the plugin active, you can select text on any page and leave an annotation that other users of the plugin can see. To keep our annotations out of the main stream of annotations coming in from all users of the plugin, please join [this hypothes.is group](https://hypothes.is/groups/nomp1bLp/dap-sg). Then, when you go to make an annotation, make sure the drop-down menu has 'DAP-sg' selected (instead of 'PUBLIC'), and then under your comment, the post button says 'post to DAP-sg'. Feel free to use descriptive tags in your annotations, too.

Alternatively, or perhaps in addition to, you can click on the 'issues' button at the top of the github page and make a new issue (you need to have a github account, of course, to do this).

## standards of conduct

We're professionals, folks. Let's keep all comments professional and generous: be as free in indicating what works well or what's a great idea, as well as in finding errors or places where things could be better.

## intellectual property

I want this thing to be used as widely as possible. All contributors will be listed as authors of the whole thing, rather like [10 Print](http://10print.org/). I've suggested the `cc-by` license below as the best way of making that happen. Good idea, bad idea? 

## one last thing

As Colombo would say, '… just one more thing'. I will be trying to add to this repository myself over the duration of my sabbatical. If no one contributes, that's fine; I'll just keep puttering away. So do check in from time to time!
