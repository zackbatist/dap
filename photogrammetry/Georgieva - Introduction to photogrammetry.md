# What is Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry allows us to create 3D images from photographs. Photographs from different angles of the object being modeled are taken. Mathematical methods such as triangulation are then applied to the photographs to measure the distances between different parts of the object, allowing for the creation of a 3D model.

Photogrammetry is quite resource intensive. For this reason it was not an easily accessible technique before. Now, however, photogrammety is accessible from our pockets. Mobile applications exist, such as 123D Catch. Additionally, one popular use for drones in archaeology is photogrammetry.

# Why do archaeologists want 3D models?
Archaeologists can use 3D models for any of the following reasons:

1. **Preservation**: One of the main purposes of archaeology. 3D models allow archaeologist to keep a record of the exact state of a site/artifact at the time of discovery. This helps with future analysis and in cases such as terrorist groups destroying archaeological sites.
2. **Analysis**: Helps archaeologists access a relatively accurate record of the site in cases when they can't physically be at the site or need to recollect some details.
3. **Presentation**: Part of archaeology is presenting the findings to the general public, to spread historical knowledge. 3D models are a good way to present the findings. These models can be combined with a virtual reality experience to allow for anyone to explore the site or view the artifact more closely. '
4. **Education**: These 3D models can also be used to 3D print artifacts for the purposes of teaching future archaeologists.
